			Hello, I'm RaiderHCPlay, a full stack developer. In programming time, I'm writing code mainly
			in <strong id="ts">TypeScript</strong>
			but I also experiment with <strong id="rs">Rust</strong> and <strong id="rb">Ruby</strong>.
			From frameworks my personal choice is <strong id="sv">SvelteKit</strong>, but I can also make
			stuff in <strong id="react">React/Next.js</strong>. Currently I explore
			<strong id="tauri">Tauri</strong> for my future project and I'm making one in
			<strong id="rn">React Native</strong>. For the rest of time, I'm a student, collector of stuff
			from my favourite franchises, manga/anime enjoyer and a gamer. I also love gazing at the moon,
			especially when it's full.
