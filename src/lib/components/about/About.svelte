	<h1>About me</h1>
	<article>
		Hello, I'm RaiderHCPlay, a full stack developer. In programming time, I'm writing code mainly in <strong
			>TypeScript</strong
		>
		but I also experiment with <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Ruby</strong>. From frameworks my
		personal choice is SvelteKit, but I can also make stuff in React, Next.js. Currently I explore
		<strong>Tauri</strong> for my future project and I'm making one in React Native. For the rest of time,
		I'm a student, collector of stuff from my favourite franchises, manga/anime enjoyer and a gamer. I
		also love gazing at the moon, especially when it's full.
