	Hello! I'm <strong>RaiderHCPlay</strong>, a full-stack web developer and student. I love coding in
	<strong>TypeScript</strong>
	but enjoy experimenting with <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Ruby</strong>. My favorite
	full-stack framework is <strong>SvelteKit</strong> — it’s clean, easy, and the icon is the coolest
	(because it's orange). When I’m not coding, I watch anime, read manga, listen to music, or play
	games like <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> or <em>DOOM</em>. I also enjoy gazing at the full moon.
	Lately, I’ve been exploring desktop apps with <strong>Tauri</strong>, diving into how stuff like
	compilers work, and learning to read and understand other people’s code. Because I value
	simplicity, comfort and flexibility, I code in Neovim on Arch Linux with Hyprland.
