	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
		Hello, I'm RaiderHCPlay, a full stack developer. In programming time, I'm writing code mainly in <strong
			id="tech">TypeScript</strong
		>
		but I also experiment with <strong id="tech">Rust</strong> and <strong id="tech">Ruby</strong>.
		From frameworks my personal choice is <strong id="tech">SvelteKit</strong>, but I can also make
		stuff in <strong id="tech">React/Next.js</strong>. Currently I explore
		<strong id="tech">Tauri</strong> for my future project and I'm making one in
		<strong id="tech">React Native</strong>. For the rest of time, I'm a student, collector of stuff
		from my favourite franchises, manga/anime enjoyer and a gamer. I also love gazing at the moon,
		especially when it's full.
