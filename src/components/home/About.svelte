	<h2>Something about me</h2>
	Hey, I’m Paweł (aka RaiderHCPlay) — a student and self-taught web dev coding in Neovim. I'm experimenting
	with Ruby for scripting, Svelte for UIs and Prisma as an ORM. When I’m not coding, you'll find me watching
	anime, reading manga, or playing a peak game like Persona 3 Reload — all while vibing to peak soundtracks.
	Currently cooking up something cool. Stay tuned.
