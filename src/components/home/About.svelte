	<h2>Something about me</h2>
	Hey, I’m Paweł (aka RaiderHCPlay) => a student & web dev coding in Neovim. I love experimenting with
	new tech like Ruby or Rust. When I’m not coding, you'll find me watching anime, reading manga, or playing
	a peak game like Persona 3 Reload. Currently, I focus on understanding others' code to learn, and building
	projects to sharpen my skills. Also, I enjoy Svelte btw.
