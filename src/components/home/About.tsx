      <h2>Something about me</h2>
      Hey, I’m Paweł (aka RaiderHCPlay) — a student & self-taught dev coding in
      Neovim, building UIs with TypeScript, React & Sass, and experimenting with
      Tailwind and Ruby. When I’m not coding, I’m watching anime, reading manga,
      or slaying demons in Doom — all while vibing to peak soundtracks.
      Currently cooking something cool. Stay tuned.
